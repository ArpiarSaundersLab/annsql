# InteRoperability

Annsql uses the duckdb api to build the database and perform operations. You can access the .asql file in R by simply installing the duckdb package and loading the library and database. Once you've loaded the db you can run any query you'd like.

## Install duckdb package
```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("duckdb", quietly = TRUE)) {
	install.packages("duckdb")
}
```
